0.0.19 : 0.0.21- Please put my library there off.

0.0.36 : 0.0.42- The next would be councilor Ward 3, that's Mark Miller.
0.0.42 : 0.0.47- Next will be Ward 4, Melinda Warren.
0.0.47 : 0.0.51- This point here will go to the approval of the agenda.
0.0.51 : 0.0.53- Can I get a mover and seconder for that?
0.0.53 : 0.0.53- Please.
0.0.53 : 0.1.3- I would like to add under maybe a new business.
0.1.3 : 0.1.10- A note with regards to King Charles III, the metal recipients.
0.1.10 : 0.1.14- Be under a new business with that be right.
0.1.14 : 0.1.15- Okay.
0.1.15 : 0.1.18- Anybody else additions or approvals of the agenda?
0.1.18 : 0.1.23- With that addition, can I get a mover or a show hands in support?
0.1.23 : 0.1.24- As you know, Mr. and his carried.
0.1.24 : 0.1.28- And then we'll go to the approval of the minutes.
0.1.28 : 0.1.30- That's item number four, mover and a seconder.
0.1.30 : 0.1.34- Patrick and Melinda.
0.1.34 : 0.1.38- I know you didn't have your hand up yet, but I just anticipate you don't do that.
0.1.38 : 0.1.43- So the committee of the whole minutes, that's February 11th of 25.
0.1.43 : 0.1.49- We do have a addition down there from Mr.
0.1.49 : 0.1.53- Daniel Page, correction to the minutes there.
0.1.53 : 0.2.0- Would anybody like to comment to the regards to item four approval of the agenda there?
0.2.0 : 0.2.5- Or I'm sorry, the minutes sorry.
0.2.5 : 0.2.9- I think the committee of the whole minutes in February 11th are fine.
0.2.9 : 0.2.15- The additions from from Mr. Page.
0.2.15 : 0.2.20- And I think they set the level where we would change it minutes.
0.2.20 : 0.2.27- Minutes are briefs and offices of the events of whatever date that might be.
0.2.27 : 0.2.35- And they're not meant for narrative transcription of the entire, in this case, here, delegation.
0.2.35 : 0.2.38- Simply said that it's too much information there.
0.2.38 : 0.2.40- It's not meant for that.
0.2.40 : 0.2.44- That's what the audio is for.
0.2.44 : 0.2.46- Mark.
0.2.46 : 0.2.49- Thank you, Mayor.
0.2.49 : 0.2.53- Dr. Daniel Page reached out to me with concerns with these draft minutes.
0.2.53 : 0.2.56- And again, he's a member of our community.
0.2.56 : 0.2.59- He's a great pair.
0.2.59 : 0.3.4- And he took the time and effort to be a delegation in front of council.
0.3.4 : 0.3.8- And in fact, in front of the community, so whole.
0.3.8 : 0.3.17- He has suggested to me and as you can see in his submission to administration and to council that they don't accurately portray his comments.
0.3.17 : 0.3.23- And I would agree with you in this case, Mayor, that it's not verbatim.
0.3.23 : 0.3.24- I agree with you 100%.
0.3.24 : 0.3.37- But at the same time, the part that is transcribed on the minutes needs to be consistent to the dialogue that the presenter, the delegation provided.
0.3.37 : 0.3.42- And we have Mr. our doctor page in the audience today in the chamber.
0.3.42 : 0.3.50- And he's sincerely taking time out of his day once again to share his concerns and to become before us.
0.3.50 : 0.3.56- But what I would like to say is that we need to be accurate in how delegations.
0.3.56 : 0.4.2- want to transmit their information because these are legal instruments that are
0.4.2 : 0.4.8- record of our deliberations and if the person who did the delegation feels that they're
0.4.8 : 0.4.20- inadequate or quite frankly, as he said, is not consistent to his words and his verbatim
0.4.20 : 0.4.25- then we need to take attention to that and I think Councillor Cachinsky, he's in your
0.4.25 : 0.4.29- he's in your ward and I think he shared some of those concerns with you too, didn't he?
0.4.29 : 0.4.37- Go ahead and yes, thank you. He is a doctor-page talk with me about his issues and he's
0.4.37 : 0.4.49- you said that even headlines of his presentation was an included in the minutes and it was like
0.4.49 : 0.4.55- misrepresenting and whatever he was saying so he would like to ask to correct them and you know
0.4.55 : 0.5.3- I don't think so it's too much to ask for it and you know and we should do subscribe like Mr. Mayor
0.5.3 : 0.5.9- I know you said that we were doing this for such a long time that why we should change I guess
0.5.9 : 0.5.15- we live an rare and every day so you know if it's somebody giving us good ideas we should
0.5.15 : 0.5.22- do not embrace that and make sure that we include everybody and we put that proper information
0.5.22 : 0.5.30- Thank you. Thank you Councillor Smellery and Kazinsky, anybody else? Go ahead the Councillor
0.5.30 : 0.5.37- Yeah, I just have a question for the CAO calling are we following the municipal act with the
0.5.37 : 0.5.42- minutes that we're doing at this time? I just believe that we would be doing that and if we're
0.5.42 : 0.5.50- not then we can change the minutes to add in but my understanding is it's not verbatim and as
0.5.50 : 0.5.57- long as we're following the act I'm good with that thank you. So I have I mean this is an a new issue
0.5.57 : 0.6.3- there seems to be a you know numerous concerns with inaccurate documentation of delegations
0.6.3 : 0.6.9- In the minutes when I spoke with the province minutes are not a legal document under the act it
0.6.9 : 0.6.15- says minutes are to be completed without notes or comments and should basically show councils
0.6.15 : 0.6.22- decisions that are being made. When I talked about delegations apparently we're going probably
0.6.22 : 0.6.27- above and beyond what other municipalities are doing. We should just be putting the name of
0.6.27 : 0.6.33- the delegate and the title of their presentation. Just last week we were at a conference I spoke
0.6.33 : 0.6.40- to other municipalities to see how they do their minutes. A lot of them don't do audio or video
0.6.40 : 0.6.45- we do the video or the audio and post that publicly so anyone can listen to the delegation
0.6.45 : 0.6.52- and hear it it's entirety and the suggestion that we should not be trying to summarize delegations
0.6.52 : 0.7.1- and clearly in our case it's it's it's not working. Thank you and I guess if I can clarify our
0.7.1 : 0.7.14- CEOs I think it's working fine just we're not able to satisfy this individual and I don't think
0.7.14 : 0.7.20- it rises to the occasion where we would have to reinvent the wheel. It hasn't been an issue before
0.7.20 : 0.7.27- and this has been going on for quite some time and there's no misrepresentations at all. There's no
0.7.27 : 0.7.35- intent with regards to that. A few things are subjective there and that's what the the transcript
0.7.35 : 0.7.41- is all about there. So I think at this point here we can vote with regards to the
0.7.41 : 0.7.45- approval of the minutes uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh...
0.7.45 : 0.7.49- of committee of the whole for February the 11th of 2025.
0.7.49 : 0.7.52- You have to read the anything on that.
0.7.52 : 0.7.55- I just got to show hands of those in support.
0.7.55 : 0.7.59- That's Councillor Warren, the fuel and terran.
0.7.59 : 0.8.1- Those opposed.
0.8.1 : 0.8.5- Councillor's Miller and Cousinsky is so passed.
0.8.5 : 0.8.8- Then we'll go to.
0.8.8 : 0.8.14- That'll be item six and that's the new business there.
0.8.14 : 0.8.17- That's the King Charles III Medal.
0.8.17 : 0.8.21- I just want to bring it to Council's attention there.
0.8.21 : 0.8.27- That King Charles III medals were handed out.
0.8.27 : 0.8.31- How the ceremony and March the 4th there at this time back.
0.8.31 : 0.8.38- Minute of Museum by Member Parlement, Ted Folk, Emily Kevin, I think.
0.8.38 : 0.8.41- And Emily Rancher Schuler.
0.8.41 : 0.8.51- The recipients are Gary Walker, a retired superintendent when a police.
0.8.51 : 0.8.53- Myself.
0.8.53 : 0.8.57- Emily Rancher and how we.
0.8.57 : 0.9.1- The ceremony was really, really well attended.
0.9.1 : 0.9.9- Many representatives from all the areas within the Ted Folk's area.
0.9.9 : 0.9.14- And really well received their assault.
0.9.14 : 0.9.19- That's what I wanted to bring to Council's attention.
0.9.19 : 0.9.21- And that's it there with the Greg.
0.9.21 : 0.9.23- Go ahead and Miller.
0.9.23 : 0.9.24- Councillor Miller.
0.9.24 : 0.9.26- Thank you, Mayor.
0.9.26 : 0.9.29- Thank you for sharing with us the King Charles.
0.9.29 : 0.9.31- Thanks, Councillor F while I'm working on the foundation of words and
0.9.31 : 0.9.35- Congratulations to those who who I guess achieved it.
0.9.35 : 0.9.40- What we don't have is a history and I guess the information of how these people
0.9.40 : 0.9.42- earned that.
0.9.42 : 0.9.46- I know there's many in our community who volunteer without recognition,
0.9.46 : 0.9.53- whether it be at the Springfield food bank or at many of the churches
0.9.53 : 0.10.0- helping hands and Steinbeck and many others in our community that go unnoticed.
0.10.0 : 0.10.6- And it seems to me that these coronation awards quite frankly go to political elites
0.10.6 : 0.10.10- or those who are associated with a political affiliation.
0.10.10 : 0.10.13- And you can clearly see that in this.
0.10.13 : 0.10.19- But what I'm saying is I'm going to raise a toast to those people in our community that
0.10.19 : 0.10.26- don't get recognized and definitely deserve recognition because there are just so many that
0.10.26 : 0.10.32- I bump into in our community from the Springfield Agriculture Society to Cook's Creek
0.10.32 : 0.10.36- to do gold community center and so, so many that again.
0.10.36 : 0.10.44- They don't need these recognitions to be, I guess, you know, congratulated on.
0.10.44 : 0.10.51- But please, please, we have to recognize and understand that there are so many in our community that do so much for us.
0.10.51 : 0.10.57- And we couldn't really have a strong community with all those people who aren't in those coronation awards.
0.10.57 : 0.10.59- So that's just my comments.
0.10.59 : 0.11.1- And I totally agree with you.
0.11.1 : 0.11.4- Any other comments or questions?
0.11.4 : 0.11.5- Okay.
0.11.5 : 0.11.8- We can move on to.
0.11.8 : 0.11.9- Which one is that one?
0.11.9 : 0.11.12- 6.1 that's unsightly by law.
0.11.12 : 0.11.15- Move on a second or for that.
0.11.15 : 0.11.17- I'll end up Patrick.
0.11.17 : 0.11.20- So this is just for information.
0.11.20 : 0.11.23- Unfortunately, Constable Zillman couldn't make it today.
0.11.23 : 0.11.29- He is one that kind of oversaw this draft of the unsightly by law.
0.11.29 : 0.11.33- So there's a few attachments here.
0.11.33 : 0.11.38- The first is the new draft of the by law.
0.11.38 : 0.11.41- The offense schedule proposed.
0.11.41 : 0.11.43- He put together just.
0.11.43 : 0.11.50- a document explaining the changes he's proposing and then just sorry today I decided to attach
0.11.50 : 0.11.56- the current bylaw just so you can see the comparison of the two. So it's a lot of information
0.11.56 : 0.12.3- to take in as I said, Constable Zillman was not able to attend today but if you've read the
0.12.3 : 0.12.11- document, have any questions we can do our best to answer them or get some answers from Jessie
0.12.11 : 0.12.20- one he is back at work? Thanks for a few. Yeah I have a question or two. My question is
0.12.20 : 0.12.27- is when we look at the draft and sadly bylaw explainer from the Springfield Police Service
0.12.27 : 0.12.35- down in the bottom it states that he would be the best interest of the municipality to have
0.12.35 : 0.12.41- two other bylaws that are like vehicle bylaw and the unlawful dumping bylaw separately
0.12.41 : 0.12.46- are we looking at that two still at this time or is this just going to be the one for all because
0.12.46 : 0.12.51- I noticed in the one that's being presented as the draft as rubbish in there so it was a little
0.12.51 : 0.12.57- confused on that. Yeah right now it still is combined as one document when we did the review I
0.12.57 : 0.13.1- think those were the points he made is that it probably would serve us better to have
0.13.1 : 0.13.8- separate documents that could take a bit longer to put those documents together so we would
0.13.8 : 0.13.14- suggest just amending our current bylaw to get it in compliance with our municipal bylaw enforcement
0.13.14 : 0.13.20- bylaw just so that we can start enforcing these things and have a little bit more teeth to it
0.13.20 : 0.13.25- and then continue to work on those additional bylaws and bring them in the future. Okay thank you
0.13.25 : 0.13.35- for that clarity. Councillor Miller thank you Mayor. I'm thankful for our for a
0.13.35 : 0.13.39- considerable settlement for preparing this document I think it's thorough and I think there's
0.13.39 : 0.13.43- definitely importance to it. One question I have though is under
0.13.43 : 0.13.51- standards and five point age. I don't really know if I could interpret it property so it says
0.13.51 : 0.13.57- regular outdoor burning the smoke of which causes a new sense to adjoining properties now
0.13.57 : 0.14.2- in my community particularly because we have such a high level of horse concentration we do have
0.14.2 : 0.14.8- individuals that do have smudges when them skittles are at high standards and we don't complain
0.14.8 : 0.14.12- because we have horses as well we don't actually do a smudge but it's just a standard kind of
0.14.12 : 0.14.18- thing that people tend to do to protect the horses from of course the viruses that mosquitoes carry
0.14.18 : 0.14.23- certainly we happen to spray our horses periodically and have blankets and other things but
0.14.23 : 0.14.30- nonetheless my question here is what does regular outdoor burning mean does it mean garbage does it mean
0.14.30 : 0.14.35- smudges does it mean other things and what does the term if you were in a court of law I'm not entirely
0.14.35 : 0.14.42- sure both lawyers for and against what argue what regular actually is interpreted as because that's
0.14.42 : 0.14.48- such a lesson wholesome kind of a word right it's very interpretive and then laws you know
0.14.48 : 0.14.56- interpretive languages depending on which lawyer you have might fight best but what does
0.14.56 : 0.15.1- Constable Zillman and or the RM of Springfield interpret as regular burning does it mean once a
0.15.1 : 0.15.8- day once a week once a month once every second week I just think it needs to be more helpful for
0.15.8 : 0.15.14- people particularly again in my ward and I'm sure in others but again because they will be
0.15.14 : 0.15.19- affected by again if this means smudges or garbage burning which of course garbage burning I don't
0.15.19 : 0.15.24- I don't absolutely support at all because of the toxins and things but carcinogens that are admitted but
0.15.24 : 0.15.29- do you know if there's any clear language on the term regular?
0.15.29 : 0.15.35- can't explain regular in this by-law, but we do have separate burning by-laws that would have
0.15.35 : 0.15.42- more details in it. So we'd probably be regulating the burning under those by-laws anyways,
0.15.42 : 0.15.48- but we do get quite regular complaints about people that are burning, whether they have a burn
0.15.48 : 0.15.54- barrel, and they're not supposed to. We try to regulate that, but if people are just having
0.15.54 : 0.16.2- regular bond fires, and it's windy, or smoke is constantly blowing into one person's yard,
0.16.2 : 0.16.9- we will get those complaints. So that's something I can take back, and we can try and, you know,
0.16.9 : 0.16.15- describe that a little better, or maybe we just refer, you know, take that out and keep
0.16.15 : 0.16.22- our own burning by-laws as the by-law that we would enforce those with. So I think this is probably
0.16.22 : 0.16.30- regular nuisance calls that we get, and so they're being addressed, but yeah, I agree with you that
0.16.30 : 0.16.39- probably has to be clarified. And just for clarification too, for my own point, some constituents or
0.16.39 : 0.16.44- members of the public have said to me that they regularly burn their garbage. Now, again,
0.16.44 : 0.16.49- I'm not entirely sure what that means, regularly means when the barrel's full, is garbage
0.16.49 : 0.16.56- burning permitted in our RM at all, at any time, on a private residence? I should know this,
0.16.56 : 0.17.4- but I think the fire chief is online. I'm going to say that burning of garbage is not permitted,
0.17.4 : 0.17.9- or shouldn't be. And that's my interpretation, but I want to be entirely accurate on how to transmit
0.17.9 : 0.17.15- that to constituents who asked that question. So I'm not asking, what you on the spot today,
0.17.15 : 0.17.20- but I think it would be helpful for counsel to know if garbage residential burning is even permitted
0.17.20 : 0.17.25- just for clarity. That's all, because it kind of focuses on this, too, to some degree,
0.17.25 : 0.17.30- because some people, I know, are burning garbage every day all the time, you know,
0.17.30 : 0.17.34- and so that would fit the term regular burning. But if we could just have clarity, that's all
0.17.34 : 0.17.39- I'm asking. I'm not trying to be a knit picker, but I think this is important for all of us.
0.17.39 : 0.17.43- I was going to say it's not even that clean garbage is allowed, but who knows what's in that
0.17.43 : 0.17.49- barrel that they're burning, and then there's noxious smells and, you know, that's where the
0.17.49 : 0.17.54- the problem starts. So, but I'll definitely clarify that with the fire chief.
0.17.54 : 0.18.10- And Colleen, you said that the burning garbage, that we have a rule and, you know, an
0.18.10 : 0.18.19- outbank or a do-go, people complaining more like in a residential area than than in a rural area.
0.18.19 : 0.18.26- I think it's more prevalent in the rural area, because the towns have garbage pickups,
0.18.26 : 0.18.31- so I don't think it's problem that they're burning garbage. It's the people I don't want to take
0.18.31 : 0.18.36- additional trips to the transfer station, and they're just collecting everything in a barrel,
0.18.36 : 0.18.41- and then burning it. But that's when you start to get the smells and, and, you know, the
0.18.41 : 0.18.48- smokes that are, are not fun to have in your backyard, so. Okay, thank you.
0.18.48 : 0.18.56- Yeah, the question is from council. I see none, and we can move on to six point two that's
0.18.56 : 0.19.3- a June district resolutions. Just a reminder for council, same as every year, we kind of have a deadline
0.19.3 : 0.19.10- to submit resolutions to the June district meetings, so June 1st is the deadline, so
0.19.10 : 0.19.15- just a reminder for council to kind of think of any ideas, speak with administration,
0.19.15 : 0.19.19- and we can start to craft those resolutions if there is anything you want to put forward.
0.19.19 : 0.19.29- Then seeing there's no further questions here, I'm prepared to close the the meeting to go into in camera items.
0.19.29 : 0.19.33- So they're kind of going to move her in a second or two go into a close meeting up, please.
0.19.33 : 0.19.35- I'll end that plan.
0.19.35 : 0.19.37- Just want to hear her in a close meeting.
0.19.37 : 0.19.39- Everybody's mics are off.
0.19.39 : 0.19.51- Thank you. We're out of close meeting at 226 unless there's other issues I'm prepared to adjourn.
0.19.51 : 0.19.53- I see none.
0.19.53 : 0.19.59- Can I just get a mover in a second or two to go to adjourmit?
0.19.59 : 0.20.1- Mark and Melinda.
0.20.1 : 0.20.9- And we'll be closing this meeting of March 11th, the 2025 community of a whole at 227pm.
0.20.9 : 0.20.11- Thank you very much.
